The House Price Prediction project can be divided into three main steps:

1. Data Preparation: This step involves collecting and cleaning the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. Model Training: In this phase, a machine learning model, such as linear regression or XGBoost, is trained using the prepared data. The model learns to identify patterns and relationships between the features and house prices.

3. Prediction and Evaluation: After training, the model is used to predict house prices on unseen data. Its performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error to assess accuracy and reliability.
